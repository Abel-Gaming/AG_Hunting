  Animal Hunting
</h1>

<p>
  Jump into the wilderness of San Andreas and make some money hunting for animals! Aniamls of any model can be added using just the model name, which can be found <a href="https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/ped-models/#animals" target="_blank">here</a>. This script allows for players to hunt certain animals
  and skin them upon killing them. At this time, the player will automatically be rewarded the money and the animal will disappear (this is to prevent skinning the same animal multiple times).
</p>

<h2>
  Future Plans
</h2>
<p>
  In the future, I do plan to make it where the player must skin the animal and then be required to sell it at a choice of multiple locations around the map. At this time, I'm not sure how soon I will get around to adding this. Feel free to fork this and add do whatever you like with it!
</p>

<h2>
  Requirements
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ox Lib <b>(Required)</b> - Script requires Ox Lib that can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib/releases" target="_blank">here</a></li>
  <li>ESX <b>(Optional)</b> - Script does allow for ESX to be enable; however, it is not required. Script has the ability in the config file to add how you would like the player to be paid</li>
</ul>
